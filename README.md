From an older github account that I lost access to
# HolyRunGameJam

This was a game I made in 24 hours. At the time, it was my first Unity project in a long time. There are a few bugs, but it would defeat the purpose of the challenge. The only bug I know of now is when you quit to the main menu to start the game again it makes it freezes the player and you must alt tab to get out of the game. The main goal of this project was to have something that I made in c# and just to have fun with it.

Overall though this project was a blast, and if you can beat my time of 5:35 you are amazing. Who knows, some of the mechanics of this game are pretty fun and the boss fight is actually super enjoyable (when it's not beyond frustrating), so maybe I'll fix the bugs and add more stuff to this game. I was looking to make it multiplayer and that would be really cool.

Download the code in the master branch (feel free to look at the scripts in c# in the assets folder) or download the game to play at this url
